## sharded &emsp; ![Build] ![Crate]

[build]: https://github.com/nkconnor/sharded/workflows/build/badge.svg
[crate]: https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sharded

**Sharded provides safe, fast, and obvious concurrent collections in Rust**. This crate splits the
underlying collection into `N shards` each with its own lock.
For further reading on the strategy, see a [write up on C++'s `parallel-hashmap`](https://greg7mdp.github.io/parallel-hashmap/).

### Features

- **Zero unsafe code.** This library uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and was motivated by
  the complexity and amount of memory errors present in many alternatives.

- **Tiny footprint.** The core logic is ~100 lines of code. This may build up over time as utilities
  and ergonomics are added. By default, the library only uses `std` and `hashbrown`. If you'd like to pull in some community
  crates such as `parking_lot`, `ahash`, etc.. just use add the corresponding feature.

- **Really fast.** This implementation may be a more performant choice than some
  of the most popular concurrent hashmaps out there. Try it on your workload and let us know.

### Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
sharded = "0.3"
```

#### Examples

**Insert a key value pair**

```rust
let users = ConcurrentHashMap::new();
users.insert(32, "Henry");
```

### Performance Comparison

These measurements were generated using [`jonhoo/bustle`](https://github.com/jonhoo/bustle). To reproduce the charts,
see the `benchmarks` directory. Benchmarks can be misleading. It is recommended to benchmark using a real application
workload.

#### Average Performance by Implementation

This ran each implementation over the presets in [`bustle::Mix`](https://docs.rs/bustle/0.4.2/bustle/struct.Mix.html) for 5
iterations / random seeds using a Intel® Core™ i9-9820X. Lower numbers are better. Approaches using a single `std::sync` Lock and `chashmap` were discarded for clarity (they are
a lot slower). If you know why `chashmap` is so slow in this test, please help here.
